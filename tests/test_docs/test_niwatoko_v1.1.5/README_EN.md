Here is the English translation:

# niwatoko v1.1.4

The Niwatoko programming language has started to provide a module import feature (world's first*).
It has become possible to process Markdown files with variables generated by Anthropic's prompt generator in Niwatoko.

## Update Contents

### Addition of Import (Citation) Feature
- It has become possible to quote the contents of other files within a Markdown file.
- This improves the reusability of the code and makes document management easier.

- The citation method is as follows:
   ```markdown
   - `variable_name` = extension [./file_path(without_extension)]
   - `variable_name` = [./file_path]
   ```
- Example:
   ```markdown
    `hello.py` = py [./hello]
    `hello.py` = [./hello.py]
   ```
- This feature is a world-first attempt.
- Note that the file extension (.py) needs to be included in the square brackets [].

### Addition of Document Variable Feature
- It has become possible to define {{variables}} within a Markdown file and reference those {{variables}} in other places.
  - For example, if you write `{{variable_name}}`, the file `variable_name.md` in the same directory will be loaded.
- This improves the readability and maintainability of the documentation.
