```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>```

The above code is an HTML file that displays the text "Hello World!" on a web page. Here's the English translation:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifies that this is an HTML5 document. The `<html>` element is the root element of the HTML document, and it contains the `<head>` and `<body>` elements.

The `<head>` element contains metadata about the web page, such as the title, which is set to "Hello World" in this case.

The `<body>` element contains the visible content of the web page, which in this case is a single `<h1>` (heading 1) element with the text "Hello World!".

When this HTML file is opened in a web browser, it will display the text "Hello World!" as the main heading on the page.
