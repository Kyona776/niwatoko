Requirements
============
I will create the following files in the `docs/` directory:

- `requirements.rst`
- `installation.rst`
- `usage.rst`
- `modules.rst`
- `contributing.rst`
- `authors.rst`
- `history.rst`

Each file will be initialized with a basic structure. Let's proceed with creating these files.

ide.new("docs/requirements.rst")
ide.new("docs/installation.rst")
ide.new("docs/usage.rst")
ide.new("docs/modules.rst")
ide.new("docs/contributing.rst")
ide.new("docs/authors.rst")
ide.new("docs/history.rst")

'File created at path: docs/history.rst'

The files have been successfully created in the `docs/` directory. What would you like to do next?

ok

If you have any more tasks or need further assistance, feel free to let me know!

中身を書いて

Let's start by populating the content for each of the newly created documentation files in the `docs/` directory. I'll begin with `requirements.rst` and proceed with the others. Here's a brief outline of what each file will contain:

1. **requirements.rst**: List of software and hardware requirements.
2. **installation.rst**: Step-by-step installation guide.
3. **usage.rst**: Instructions on how to use the software.
4. **modules.rst**: Information about the software modules.
5. **contributing.rst**: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
6. **authors.rst**: List of authors and contributors.
7. **history.rst**: Version history and changelog.

I'll start by writing the content for `requirements.rst`.

ide.edit("docs/requirements.rst", "List the software and hardware requirements for the niwatoko package.")

Failure.

OK (no output).

MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION THAT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW: List the software and hardware requirements for the niwatoko package.
