niwatoko Language Usage
======================

Using the niwatoko Language
---------------------------

Once you have installed the niwatoko language, you can start using it. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Activate the virtual environment if you installed niwatoko in a virtual environment.

   On macOS/Linux:
   
   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   On Windows:
   
   ```
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Run the niwatoko interpreter to start using the language.

   ```
   niwatoko
   ```

   This will start the niwatoko interactive shell, where you can write and execute niwatoko code.

4. To exit the niwatoko interactive shell, type `exit()` and press Enter.

Running niwatoko Scripts
------------------------

You can also run niwatoko scripts from files. Create a file with a `.nw` extension and write your niwatoko code in it. Then, run the script using the following command:

```
niwatoko script.nw
```

Replace `script.nw` with the name of your niwatoko script file.

Integrating niwatoko with Other Tools
-------------------------------------

niwatoko can be integrated with other tools and libraries. For example, you can use niwatoko scripts in your Python projects by calling the `niwatoko` command from your Python code. This allows you to leverage the capabilities of the niwatoko language within your Python applications.

Additionally, you can use niwatoko in various development environments, such as Jupyter Notebooks, by installing the appropriate niwatoko kernel or integration.

Refer to the niwatoko documentation for more information on advanced usage and integration with other tools.
